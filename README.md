# odin-rock-paper-scissors

My version of TOP's Project: Rock Paper Scissors. You can find the directions I followed to create the basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript [here](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-rock-paper-scissors)!

## What?

This project is to create a webpage where the user plays rock paper scissors against the computer. If the user wins five separate games, then they win the entire webpage game. If the computer wins five separate games, then the user loses the entire webpage game. The JavaScript file allows the user interaction to work, and calculates the computer's choice and the winner of each separate game.

## Why?

This project exists to show the basics of user interaction with JavaScript.
